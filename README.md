# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

# Description of Project: What it does, aim, and what you learned 

This project is a traditional hangman game, where a player has 5 lives to guess a word by guessing one letter at a time. 

This game will automatically select a random word by using pythons random import module, from a predifined list of words. 


I learned how to problem solve during this project and how coding a game is more complicated than I might have initially expected. 

Ulitmately, I'd like to improve upon this game, and will continue to refine this project.
